This Project is Connect 4 in C# and XAML. The code gets the name of the players and stores them in 
local storage to remember the next time the application is opened. If the players don't enter their names, they 
are defaulted to player1 and player2. They can choose either basic colour, Red or Yellow, and dependant on who 
chose what colour depicts the colour of the end screen where the winner is shown.After a first match is played 
the users can either restart the game or end it which display a message which thanks them for playing.
